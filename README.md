# NetSuite AI Assistant Builder

🤖 **AI-Powered Blueprint Repository for Building Custom NetSuite AI Assistants**

This repository contains comprehensive blueprints for building a production-ready NetSuite AI Assistant. Clone this repo, rename it to your project, and use AI tools (like Cursor) to execute the blueprints and build your own customized assistant.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone & Customize

```bash
# Clone the blueprints repository
git clone https://github.com/opensuitemcp/ai-builder-blueprints.git mycustomassistant
cd mycustomassistant

# IMPORTANT: Rename to your project name
# This will be used throughout the build process
# Examples: acme-netsuite-ai, company-assistant, netsuite-helper
```

### 2. Open in AI-Powered Editor

- Open in **Cursor** (recommended) or any AI-powered IDE
- The AI will read `BUILD_BLUEPRINTS.md` and execute the instructions

### 3. Tell AI to Build

```
"Execute the blueprints in BUILD_BLUEPRINTS.md to build my NetSuite AI Assistant. 
Use the project name 'mycustomassistant' for all files, directories, and configurations."
```

### 4. Project Naming Tips

- **Use descriptive names**: `acme-netsuite-ai`, `company-assistant`, `netsuite-helper`
- **Avoid spaces**: Use hyphens or underscores instead
- **Keep it short**: Easy to type and remember
- **Make it unique**: Your assistant's identity
